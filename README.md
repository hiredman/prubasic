# prubasic

A Clojure library designed compile a BASIC like language to the
instruction set of TI's PRUs (specifically the ones that are built
into the beaglebone)

## Usage

the function `prubasic.core/compile-basic` can be bassed a string of
BASIC code and it will return a byte array containing the compiled code

```clojure
prubasic.core>   (compile-basic
   "
10 LET temp = 0x0
20 LET fib = 0x1
30 FOR number = 0x1 TO 0x10
40   LET pair = temp + fib
50   LET temp = fib
60   LET fib = pair
70 NEXT number
71 WRITE fib 0x0
80 END
")
#<byte[] [B@572c0127>
prubasic.core> 
```

This example program calculates fib(16) and writes the result as a
32bit integer to the base address of the PRU's data ram, where you can
read it out afterwards. 

the BASIC dialect has 8 commands:
  - LET
  - FOR
  - NEXT
  - IF (needs to be finished, it is in the parser though)
  - GOTO (needs to be finished, it is in the parser though)
  - END
  - READ
  - WRITE

READ/WRITE are for writing to the PRU's data ram, which can be used to
communicate results or pass arguments. They take a variable to be
written to and an offset to read/write from, offsets are in bytes, so
for 32bit ints use units of eight.

Speaking of variables, the compiler just maps names to registers, so
don't use more than 28 variables (the compiler uses a few of the 32
general purpose registers for bookkeeping)

The only value types currently supported are 32bit integers which must
be written in hex.

The only operator on values is currently +.

Really there is just enough functionality here to make fib work.

Loading the generated code in to the PRU is still kind of a pain,
hopefully that will get better soon.
